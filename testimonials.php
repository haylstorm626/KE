					The main panel in my house failed and had to be replaced. Harlan was able to complete the job quickly even though he had standing commitments to other customers. He was willing to do whatever it took to get us up and running including working extended evening hours. His work was very professional, very neat and he communicated his schedules well. I highly recommend Harlan.
